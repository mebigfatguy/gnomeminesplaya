GnomeMinesPlaya is a java application that launches and plays the Gnome Mines game.

It uses java.awt.Robot to set up the game and to perform cell selections, and also to take
screen shots to determine what the state of the board. The board values are determined by processing
the images for each square after actions are taken.

It currently works with Ubuntu 10.10 and previous, as it appears that the Natty Mines (or perhaps the
Unity Mines) has changed the default UNKNOWN cell to an orange color. Will need to add support for that.

Also Unity does goofy things with menus, so changing the state to 'Large' doesn't work on Unity 
currently.
